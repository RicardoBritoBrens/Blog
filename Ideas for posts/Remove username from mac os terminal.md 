3. Find the line that starts with PS1=. The complete line should be something like this: PS1='[\u@\h \W]\$ ' where \u represents the username, \h the hostname and \W your location in the file structure.

bashrc-ps1-line
4. To remove the username and hostname from the prompt, simply remove the \u@\h part so it looks like this: PS1='[\W]\$ '.

5. For pure minimalism, you can remove everything and just leave the prompt sign: PS1='\$ '.
