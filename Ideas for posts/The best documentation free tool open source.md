# The best documentation tool open source

Since the first day I start to learn how software development works I always feel that it was incredible that there are soo many programming languages and you can learn by yourself and even find job with that knowledge.

Now days people do not think to much of these possibilities because they often have the opportunity to learn about software development on collage but for my it's just awesome.

One topic about the software development is the way documentation has changed.

There are some kind of documentation but the common one is a consider amount of text that we organize in categories and sections depending of the company requesting that even signatures to approve the release of a new software version.

People we are in 2021, changes is the reason why that we developer exist, it's time to automate.

Lazy is the mother of great ideas.

I ones worked in a middle company that has a not requirements about creating documentation about the software they produce as you can imagine this results in too many complex scenarios about end users requesting manuals and training that has to be provide by the same developer that write the code.

I also worked in a big company where they have a structure steps about how they create documentation so structure that they tell you how you need to arrange the 20 to 19 sections where you can find the big one..., yes the code they tell you that you need to print the code just to have something physical about who did the change and what was the exact change about.

The second scenario was better than the first but as my experience with the project grow sometime I felt that documentation takes my more than write the code itself also the same experience tech me that the documentation is an important piece of software and it has to be and well done.

One day I was reading about swagger an open source tool to document API I took a little review but as it was just to API this does not have the flexibilities I was looking for, but then a get a result on google by searching *best open source tools to create documentation about software using markdown*, so i get Read The Docs, Doxygen and one for Angular call campodoc, I red some of then and discover the .md extensi√≥n which open a new whole world for my.

For my next google search a look for *best markdown documentation open source tool* and i discover MkDocs that is a open source project which use python to generate a static site base on Markdown files.
